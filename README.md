## Required software & Installation guide

- Download and install node.js

## How to execute test via docker image

- Pull the docker image from docker hub : `docker pull buddhika88/veriffqarepo:f51a2c31789b07b3bc56e7673704f46f15ce51f7`
- Run the docker image and open the terminal
- Execute command to run all (UI and API): `npm run test`
- Execute command to run Specific Test File: `npm run test <Test File Name>`
- Execute command to run only UI Tests: `npm run test --testDir ./src/tests/UI`
- Execute command to run only API Tests: `npm run test --testDir ./src/tests/API`
- Execute command to run Smoke tests: `npm run test:smoke`

## How to execute the tests in command line

- Clone the project
- Open the cmd and change directory(cd) to the cloned project folder
- Execute command to update packages: `npm install or npm ci`
- Execute command to run all (UI and API): `npm run test`
- Execute command to run Specific Test File: `npm run test <Test File Name>`
- Execute command to run only UI Tests: `npm run test --testDir ./src/tests/UI`
- Execute command to run only API Tests: `npm run test --testDir ./src/tests/API`
- Execute command to run Smoke tests: `npm run test:smoke`
- Wait for tests to be completed and results will be in the console (please refer below to get a comprehensive report)

## How to execute test with comprehensive reports

- **Execute command to run the tests with allure report enabled** : `npm run test:reporter`
- Then to generate Html report execute : `npm run allure-report`

## Things to highlight

    1. Environmental data, such as url's, are been maintained in a separate `playwright.config.js`
    file to ease the maintainability enviorment wise you have to keep a separate config file.
    2. Resuable functions created in order for readability and maintainability
    3. Test types are tagged in test automation in order to execute in groups (eg: @Smoke.. )
    4. Reporting has been implemented through Allure reporting
    5. CI/CD process is fully automated through github workflows (enviorment & Automation code)containerized and push to DockerHub as a docker image

## About the project structure

| Package Name         | File                   | Description                                                                                               |
| :------------------- | :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src\helpers`        | `relativeUrl.js`       | Project relative/resource URLs are stored in there                                                        |
| `src\test`           | `Multiple Files`       | API and UI Tests are included here                                                                        |

| `src\test-resources` | `schemas.json`         | Implemented to store all the responce schemas                                                             |
|                      | `api_test_data,json`   | Implemented to store all the request payloads                                                             |

| `root`               | `playwright.config.js` | This contain Playwright enviorment spesific data including timeouts, baseURL, reporting, browsers ..etc.. |
|                      | `Dockerfile`           | This contain the Playwright dockerimage                                                                   |

## How Project works in CI/CD

- Once the automation code is commited to github
- It will trigger github workflows through playwright.yml file
- It will get the Dockerfile in the project
- Then it will pull the playwright image and it will include the automation code
- Then image will be pushed to DockerHub
- Finally in the test stage in .yml file it will pull the created docker image from docker hub and execute the test

Note: Please keep in mind that in a perfect environment, after a code change, the tests should be run and only then should further action be taken if the tests pass. This has been done Â in order to demonstrate how integration should work.
